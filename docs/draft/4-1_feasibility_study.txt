4.1 FEASIBILITY STUDY



4.1.1 Technical Feasibility
The system is a network application. Main technologies used with the application are:
-Java (backend and Network programming)
-MySQL (Database)
-XMPP (Message Server)
-GPG (encryption and Signing tool)

Each of these technologies is freely available and technical skills required are manageable. As most of the abovementioned technologies are open-source and well documented project development and ease of implementing these technologies are manageable.

clearly, the project is technically feasible.


4.1.2 Operational Feasibility
As the system purpose is to provide communication over network, it is expected of communicating parties to have internet connection as well as a computer. Necessary requirements for the application use are:
-Computing devices (act as client, server)
-Internet connection
-Technical knowledge

Compters and Internet is common now a day and the project is developed for niche users (technically competent); the project is believed to be operationally feasible.


4.1.3 Economical Feasibility
In conclusion, it can be declared that the system is feasible for development and use as there are no severe technical, operational and economical challenges.

The software will be provided for free of cost as well as its source code will be made publicly available, eliminating the need for technical support as the user community can help one another by examining the source code and documentation.

Therefore, the application doesn't sustain any other charges except for internet connectivity charges at the user end.


In conclusion, it can be declared that the system is feasible for development and use as there are no severe technical, operational and economical chalenges.
